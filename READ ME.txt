
-PURPOSE

The purpose of this dynamo code is to automate the synchronization of data between the 
external lighting schedule which is in excel,the Revit lighting fixture families,and 
the built-in Revit lighting schedule.

-HOW IT WORKS

--Excel
	In excel, you will have to make sure the schedule is aligned with the guidelines found in the Excel Schedule Rules.txt in the documentation folder.

--Dynamo
	1)The code will pull in the excel light fixture schedule and organize/categorize the data in the Excel Fixture Schedule Access Point section.

	2)Each different light fixture families that are hosted in the model are accounted for and organized in the Revit Element Acess Point section.

	3)Both the Excel data and the Revit fixture family data(including parameters) are inputed into the iron python script "The Brain" and are matched and indexed.

	4)After, the index position is set, all of the column data (such as desciption,wattage,color,etc) are organized and placed in the corresponding 
  	  index position so that the correct excel data aligns with correct revit fixture type.

	5)Once the iron python script is complete it will output the indexed data to the Revit Element Data Sync section. 
	  With the dynamo node "Element.SetParameterByName", the indexed revit family data is inputed into the element section, 
	  the indexed parameters are inputed into the parameter section, and the corresponded indexed excel data are inputed into the value section.
  	  This node takes all inputed data and updates the parameter values for revit fixture types in the model. 

--Revit
	In revit, you will have to create a schedule using to the same parameter fields found in the Fixture Family Rule.txt in the documentation folder.
